      <description>Regular expressions (regex) detect patterns in strings of text for locating/altering specific text. For example, in the following string of text, findall can be used to locate all instances of “just” followed by any character (signified by “.”) any amount of times (signified by “+”), split can be used to split the string where there is a comma followed by a space, and sub can replace text in the string with another text.</description>

      <description>EDA ProjectDataBoth data sets were retrieved from github. The tv_ratings dataset includes a title ID, season number, title of the TV show, date the show was first aired, average rating, share, and genres. The movie_profit dataset includes the name of the movie, studio, the production budget, the domestic revenue (USA), worldwide revenue, distributor of the film, MPAA rating, and genre. I selected these because of my interest in TV and film.</description>
